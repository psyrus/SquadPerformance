        <h1 class="display-3">How to contribute</h1>
        <p>Due to the lack of benchmarking tools integrated into the main squad program, the smoothest solution that I could come up with was using a combination of free software and the "honor system" (I'm trusting the submissions) to establish some decent performance baselines for squad players around the world. </p>

        <p>Ideally, if this system garners a few thousand submissions from a range of systems, it will provide a very feasible way to gauge any player's performance based on their specifications.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>The submission process is slightly longwinded but to ensure consistency between users, it unfortunately has to be so. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Login (through steam)</li>
    <li>Enter hardware specs</li>
    <li>Download and install Fraps (trial version)</li>
    <li>Set up benchmark key (F11 default)</li>
    <li>Set benchmark to record 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Set benchmark to only record FPS</li>
    <li>Record benchmark and write down which benchmark is on what map
        <ul>
            <li>one per game</li>
            <li>try to record when near the center of the map, or in intense action. Recording the briefing screen or the initial rollout is not very helpful to gauge performance</li>
            <li>only if >75 players are present</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Submit benchmark(s)</li>
    <li>Wait for approval from the admin to see your scores show up in the global stats</li>
</ul>
